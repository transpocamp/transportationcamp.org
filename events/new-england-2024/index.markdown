It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a diverse gathering of fellow enthusiasts. TransportationCamp welcomes all attendees, whether you&#39;re a planner, software developer, engineer, student, transportation professional, community member, policy maker, or just excited about mobility!

## Things To Know

- **First time at an unconference?**: Check out [How TransportationCamp works: the essential guide](/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide) for a quick introduction!
- **Dress code**: It's an unconference—tasteful casual is fine!
- **Internet access**: Free Wi-Fi will be available in all event spaces—we'll have more information when you check in.
- **Presentation pointers**: Many breakout rooms have a projector, so if you’re thinking of proposing a session and you’d like to present, bring a laptop. We’ll supply a display cable & will bring as many adaptors as possible, but bring an adaptor for your laptop just in case. Most breakout rooms will also have a chalkboard.

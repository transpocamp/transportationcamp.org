### TransportationCamp NYC 2024 is returning to Brooklyn!

TransportationCamp NYC will be held on Saturday, October 26th at NYU&#39;s Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown
Brooklyn. Join us to discuss all things transportation and connect with professionals, students, and enthusiasts alike!

TransportationCamp is an **[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)** - every session is **planned,
proposed, and led by attendees like you**. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a
diverse gathering of individuals from our multidisciplinary industry.

TransportationCamp welcomes all attendees, whether you&#39;re a planner,
software developer, engineer, student, transportation professional, community member, policymaker, or just excited
about mobility!

### Presenting?

Thinking about presenting at a session? Sessions may come in a variety of formats: informal discussions,
birds-of-a-feather, lightning talks, presentations, open space technology, and others. We welcome experts, but really
you just need to care about transportation issues or be nerds about it like us. The important thing is that you bring
your ideas and enthusiasm, and engage! All the breakout rooms are equipped with a projector or whiteboard. We will
be handing out **session idea cards** throughout registration. If you have an idea for a session, feel free to write it
down in advance and bring it with you to the event.

### Student Scholarship

Applications for the $500 student scholarship were due on Sunday, October 20. The winner will be announced during the
opening session of Camp on Saturday!

### Post-Camp Happy Hour

We'll be hosting a happy hour immediately after TCNYC in collaboration with our friends at YPT-NYC. Join us
at [Livingston Manor](https://www.livingstonmanorbk.com/) to continue your conversations from the unconference before
heading out for the night!

### First Time at a TransportationCamp?

  If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.

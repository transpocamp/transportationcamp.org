### TransportationCamp NYC 2024 is returning to Brooklyn!

TransportationCamp NYC will be held on Saturday, October 26th at NYU&#39;s Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown
Brooklyn. Join us to discuss all things transportation and connect with professionals, students, and enthusiasts alike!

TransportationCamp is an **[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)** - every session is **planned,
proposed, and led by attendees like you**. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a
diverse gathering of individuals from our multidisciplinary industry.

TransportationCamp welcomes all attendees, whether you&#39;re a planner,
software developer, engineer, student, transportation professional, community member, policymaker, or just excited

### Presenting?

Thinking about presenting at a session? Sessions may come in a variety of formats: informal discussions,
birds-of-a-feather, lightning talks, presentations, open space technology, and others. We welcome experts, but really
you just need to care about transportation issues or be nerds about it like us. The important thing is that you bring
your ideas and enthusiasm, and engage! All the breakout rooms are equipped with a projector or whiteboard. We will
be handing out **session idea cards** throughout registration. If you have an idea for a session, feel free to write it
down in advance and bring it with you to the event.

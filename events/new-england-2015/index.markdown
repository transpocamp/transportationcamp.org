The 2nd Annual Transportation Camp New England will be held on Saturday, April 11, 2015.

Following on the success of last year's event, TransportationCamp New England 2015 will continue to foster open conversation and collaboration between all parties interested in mobility and the  radical changes the near-future promises in transportation.

Our goal is to assemble planners, dreamers, programmers, students, and professionals for an exciting day of "un-conferencing." Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event. Therefore, we want to see what you are doing; we want to ask how it will impact our lives; and we want to help you to find answers.

Some of this year’s session topics will included:

* Bike share applications and technology
* Open source data and standards
* Impacts of autonomous and connected vehicles
* Drones, current applications and future implications
* The science behind Hyperloop -the conceptual high-speed transportation system
* Making data matter
* Improving mobility in Boston (and beyond!)
* Transformative trends in transportation

Located two blocks west of the Kendall T-Station (Red Line) and between several garages, the Stata Center is easily accessible by car or public transit, parking information and directions from the T are available [here](http://www.gbcacm.org/venues/cambridge/mit-building-32-stata-center.html).

There will be four periods for breakout sessions. The sessions will be proposed throughout the event and scheduled after the introductory session. Each session will have notes available on shared documents via [Hackpad](https://tcamp2015ne.hackpad.com/) that everyone is encouraged to edit (in real time). If you're in a session and mention a link, it's a good idea to add the link to the notes for that session.

The [Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT) Boston Chapter](http://www.yptboston.org/) will host a happy hour after the event.  Stay tuned for more details to come!

<h1><center>TransportationCamp PHL is back yet again on <b>March 22, 2025!</b></center></h1>

![Scenes from TransportationCamp PHL 2019](/events/phl2018/Scenes%20from%20TCPHL18.jpg)

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you ***physically*** to our nation's birthplace at the center of the NEC for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism. As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event.

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia Chapter and Mid-Atlantic Region of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT), the Philadelphia Chapter of Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and the Mid-Atlantic Section of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (MASITE, ITE), we look forward to seeing you!

## <a name="Logistics"></a> Logistics

We pioneered the virtual model for three years in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, but after two years back in-person, we're pleased to return to the same venue we've called our in-person home since 2018.

Summer 2021 also launched our spin-off "TCPHL Summer Gathering" event, combining urban exploration and an outdoor happy hour, which returned by popular demand for 2022, 2023, and 2024. **We're pleased to announce that will yet again return in Summer 2025**, so make sure to see us again and reconnect with connections made both in years past and at this year's in-person conference.

## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two Feet:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp has always been a very casual event, especially via the virtual format. We've always said, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp PHL is organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and MASITE.
Passionate about transportation and bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting.
For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).

**The TCPHL23 team is pleased to be hosting our fourth-annual Summer Gathering event on Saturday, August 3, 2024.**

Initially formed as an extension of our 2021 virtual conference to offer a safe, outdoor in-person experience, the event was such a blast, we're keeping it going as a standalone eventâ€¦ even as we've returned to an in-person conference!

As with years past, the event will feature a day of urban exploration with fellow TransportationCamp participants, concluding with a happy hour in the afternoon. What's it like? Check out photos from [2021](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DdT942CXyG12tDJN8) and [2022](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bCfRhqu6ZzQitYmw6).

The event is open to recent and former attendees of TransportationCamp PHL, other TransportationCamp conferences, members of YPT chapters from Philadelphia and beyond, and their friends and family. (Yes, weâ€™re family-friendly, and have had some families join!)

Are you a local or looking to make a long weekend out of it? Our event is designed to help you make the most out of your time in the Philadelphia region.

We're ecstatic to be seeing you in-person in \*\*June\*\*, hopefully with nice (but not scorching) weather! Let the summer fun commence!

*Tickets are complimentary; there is no charge to participate, although food, transportation, and admission to any activities (e.g. museums, events, sports) are not included.*

<center><img src="/events/phl2022-summer/art_museum.jpg" width="45%" height="auto" style="border: 1px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px grey;"/> </center>

At 11:30am, we will kickoff the second-annual TransportationCamp PHL Exploration Challenge! The unique choose-your-own-adventure format encourages attendees to meet new people in small groups of around 5 (+/- 2), explore the city's transportation highlights, and see some of Philadelphia's best attractions.

Groups will form at 11:30am, so if you're coming by yourself or a couple, you'll be able to meet other attendees before the challenge commences and set out on your exploration with others. Feel free to invite your significant other, family, and friends.

Participants will be provided a map of key locations in the Philadelphia region â€” both transit-related and not â€” and an associated "point value," earned by posting a photo of the entire team at their designated location to a designated channel on the TransportationCamp PHL Slack. Teams may also opt to complete "challenges" for additional bonus points. **The team that earns the most points will win a prize!**

### Afternoon Gathering & Happy Hour [4-5:30pm]

The challenge will conclude at 3:30pm, followed by the Afternoon Gathering at [Cira Green](https://ciragreen.com/about/) â€” a unique elevated urban park located one block from 30th Street Station â€” or a similar location TBA. Snacks and beverages are available at [Sunset Social](https://sunsetsocialphl.com/) in the park.

This will be a time to discuss the things you saw, transportation developments in to Philadelphia and beyond, and to connect with likeminded individuals.

We'll also use that time to recognize our winners and distribute prizes.

### [OPTIONAL] After the event

Are you local or making a weekend trip? After the event concludes, there's tons of great ways to extend the fun. Coordinate plans with other attendees in the event slack's #2023-summer-weekend channel. Some suggestions:

- Get tickets to a Phillies game vs the Mets on Friday night or Sunday afternoon
- Continue exploring the Philadelphia region with other newfound friends, including other sights on the map you didn't get to visit
- Go "down the shore" and spend a night in "America's Playground" of Atlantic City, then wake up to miles of gorgeous beaches along the boardwalk

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp PHL is organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel University. Passionate about transportation and bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting. For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).

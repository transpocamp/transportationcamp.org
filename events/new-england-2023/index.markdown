<h1 style="color: #FF6600;">TransportationCamp New England is back!</h1>

After a 3 year hiatus, we return in-person for New England’s 6th annual camp on Saturday, October 7th at [MIT](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9dkojPAdqRk4jbZt8)! Join us to be a part of the conversation on all topics of mobility in this open and inclusive event.

TransportationCamp is an **[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)** - every session is **planned, proposed, and led by attendees like you**. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a diverse gathering of fellow enthusiasts. TransportationCamp welcomes all attendees, whether you&#39;re a planner, software developer, engineer, student, transportation professional, community member, policy maker, or just excited about mobility!

<h1><center>After leading the way in virtual conferences, TransportationCamp PHL is back in-person for 2023!</center></h1>

![Scenes from TransportationCamp PHL 2019](/events/phl2018/Scenes%20from%20TCPHL18.jpg)

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you ***physically*** to our nation's birthplace at the center of the NEC for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism. As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event.

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia Chapter and Mid-Atlantic Region of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT), the Philadelphia Chapter of Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at Drexel University, we look forward to seeing you!

## <a name="Logistics"></a> Logistics

Necessity is the mother of invention, as it was three years ago when we pioneered the virtual model. But our ability to return in-person has arrived, and **we couldn't be more thrilled to host another engaging conference back in the physical space we've called home since we began five years ago.**

Summer 2021 also launched our spin-off "TCPHL Summer Gathering" event, combining urban exploration and an outdoor happy hour, which returned by popular demand for 2022. **We're pleased to announce that too will return in Summer 2023**, so make sure to come see us again and reconnect with the connections made in years past and at this year's in-person conference.

## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

Despite being virtual, this event will still follow the standard guidelines and practices from a normal TransportationCamp event. Here are some details.

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two Feet:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp has always been a very casual event, especially via the virtual format. We've always said, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp PHL is organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel University.
Passionate about transportation and bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting.
For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).
